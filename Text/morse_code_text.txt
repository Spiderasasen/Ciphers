If you see this, then it means that its more and more diffcult to read it.
Now im not going to fix it
you may as "why" and its simple
this section of the code will be incorperated in an ARG that me and a buddy of mine are working
the main text testers (text.txt) is to see if a cipher works
but for this morse code i want it to show that something is trying to silence them
im not going to say anything about it but lets say the government is trying to bring back something
something that should have stayed in the 60s
have a good day aginet
