# Ciphers
This is where i will experiment on making an AI cipher and decipher some hard-coded messages. If you wish to also encrypt and decrypt some of your messages, that is also possible for y'all

#Main idea
Here we will make it possible for the user to encrypt or decrypt some messages by the following ciphers
  - Ceaser Cipher
  - Atbash Cipher
  - ROT 13 Cipher
  - Vigenere Cipher
But if the user wants to see AI try to decrypt some hard-coded words, then there will be an option to see that happen.
The AI will get the message and will brought force, or try to figure it out using some complex algorithms.

#why im doing this?
This is a side project. i will work on making the code for the AI to decipher the hard-coded words, and also the system that makes the encryption and decryption, so the user can also work on.
I might also add more ciphers and or codes for the user to use if they want.
